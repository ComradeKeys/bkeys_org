	  All of the software I have written is published in public Git repos on my <a href="https://github.com/ComradeKeys/">Github profile</a>. The source code can be viewed there and downloaded. All of the software I have published is under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">free licenses</a>. On this page I present screenshots from the projects current state and talk briefly about each.

	<h2 class="text-center">3D_Snake</h2>
	<img class="center-block img-responsive" src="../img/snake.png">
	<article class="text-justify">
	  3D Snake is my implementation of the classic arcade game Nibbles, also known as Snake. My version has obstacles that the snake can run into in addition to running out of the arena. The only real difference is I used OpenGL to tilt the board giving it a 3D visual effect. The board itself also features transparency.

	  Is the website you are currently viewing. I use this website to tell the world about myself, and what I can (and like) to do. I used Bootstrap 3 to create this website, however I am excited about the <a href="http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/08/19/bootstrap-4-alpha/">4th bootstrap release</a>, though I do not think it is mature enough yet for real use. I try my best to make sure this site conforms to all web standards and that is renders correctly on all browsers. If you have issues with viewing the site please email me at <a href="mailto:bkeys@bkeys.org">bkeys@bkeys.org</a> and tell me about it.

	<h2 class="text-center">GL_Less</h2>
	<img class="center-block img-responsive" src="../img/gl_less.png">
	<article class="text-justify">
	  These are lessons that are taught in the ACM OpenGL class at BYU-Idaho, they imply that a person has a basic understanding of the C++11 programming langauge, which is the first language taught at the school. It does not imply any knowledge of graphics. They are supposed to elevate a person's understanding of the library to an intermediate level, implementing shaders, loading 3D models, and alot more. The lessons features many samples that show each concept used in a real software. I am collaborating on this lesson series with Dane Christensen.

	<h2 class="text-center">KC_Lib</h2>
	<img class="center-block img-responsive" src="../img/kc_lib.png">
	<article class="text-justify">
	  Another project I am working on with Dane, this is a game engine of sorts. It handles graphics, collision, audio, and even networking. Dane has done alot of the work on this project; I was responsible for the audio implementation. If we get this done we plan to create a small game about aviation using this library.

	<h2 class="text-center">Sudoku</h2>
	<img class="center-block img-responsive" src="../img/sudoku.png">
	<article class="text-justify">
	  For my Intro to Software Development class, our final project was to create a command line implementation of the classic game Sudoku. After I learned how to use OpenGL and FreeGlut, I decided I was going to take the day and make my own graphical version of the game. It is very simple and has minimal features, however the game is completely playable.
